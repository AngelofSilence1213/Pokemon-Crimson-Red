# Shin Pok√©mon Red and Blue

Version 1.23.XX

This is a rom hack of pokemon red & blue based on the Pret team's disassembly.  
It's a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing game engine bugs and oversights from the original game.  
Additionally, trainer AI routines are improved and multiple quality-of-life improvements have been added.  
Think of it as what the Nintendo Virtual Console re-release of red & blue might have been (plus a few extra goodies). 

Read the "Guide to New Player Functions" for instructions on all the new stuff the player can do.

Don't like the non-vanilla changes? Prefer only the bugfixes and AI improvements? Want a codebase from which to launch your own rom hack?
Then the [Lite branch](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/tree/lite) is what you want. Head on over and start compiling.

A bash script randomizer, "randoshinred", is now in beta test.

**IMPORTANT**: Download the BPS patch file of the version you want and apply it to the correct USA rom. 
- The "_origback" BPS patches are alternatives for red & blue that keep the original back sprites. 
- Use the tool [FLIPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/) to apply the BPS patches.   
- **Red patches (shin pokemon red, red_origback, and red-jp) are applied to a USA Red ROM.**
- **All other patches (Blues and Greens) are applied to a USA Blue ROM.**


***Includes Pokemon Green and Japanese Red!***
- The compiler primarily builds the graphics and cerulean cave layout back to the original japanese release.
- Pokedex entries adapt the original Green version text that was translated in Fire Red.
- Pokedex uses metric units.

***Now Includes Japanese Blue!***
- Primarily builds the lists for encounters, trades, and prizes that were in the never-localized japanese release.
- Pokedex uses metric units.

***Updating Your Save File***
Deactivate all special options and NPC toggles in the old save if it's from an earlier patch.  
When loading an old save file with the latest patch, the player is automatically warped to Pallet Town.  
Normally this will be enough to update the save file without doing anything else.  
It's possible you may still have issues upon loading a save from a previous patch or an unpatched game.  
To prevent this from happening, save in the outdoor Pallet Town map on the old save.  
You might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.  
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Pallet Town.

#Summary
-----------

***Lite features for a cleaned-up purist experience***

A huge number of bugs, glitches, oversights, and text errors of all sorts have been fixed. 
There are too many to enumerate in a simple summary, and some of them are very obscure or previously undiscovered.

Includes english builds of Green and Red-JP versions. 
It swaps the graphics, Cerulean Cave layout, and a few lines of text to replicate the original japanese releases.
The original release pokedex entries have been adapted from the Fire Red translations.
It also has all the pokedex data in metric.

Includes an english build of Blue-JP version.
It swaps prizes, trades, wild encounter data, and some text to replicate the original japanese release.
It also has all the pokedex data in metric.

Engine features from USA Yellow version have been backported.
Super Gameboy palettes get converted to display on the Gameboy Color. No more monochrome!
Attack animations are colored according to type during Gameboy Color play.
The audio engine is backported for stereo sound support. 

New options that can be toggled!
- Hit SELECT on the options screen to cycle through the audio output types.
- Playing in GBC mode on a backlit LCD screen? Press SELECT at the copyright screen to activate color correction.
- Experimental 60FPS Mode: Place the cursor over CANCEL in the options screen and toggle by pressing left or right.
- Zero-Delay Text: Text with zero frame delay can be toggled in the options menu; press LEFT with the cursor on FAST.

Trainer AI has been improved and greatly expanded. 
Some trainers will even try to switch pokemon intelligently.

You get notified when a box is filled (either via catching or depositing a pokemon).

Switching out of a trapping move wastes the trapper's turn. 
This prevents unbeatable AI scenarios as well as a PP underflow glitch.

Rage is limited to 2-3 turns but attack boosts are kept.
This is primarily to prevent infinite battle loops.

Sleep does not prevent choosing a move, and the move is used upon waking up.
To maintain sleep move accuracy, sleep starts with a counter of at least 2.
And Rest now sets the sleep counter to 3.   
   
   
***Additional Master features that go beyond engine modifications and fixes***

All 151 pkmn are available in one version (rarities may vary per version).

You can play as a boy or a girl.

There's an EXP bar in battle.

You can hunt for shiny pokemon, and they are valid with Gen 2 games.

No more grinding wild pokemon. Nearly all trainers can be rematched just by talking to them once or twice.

The "SET" battle style gives increased difficulty by making the stats of trainer pokemon more on your level.
It also doubles the effect of the X-stat items that AI trainers are fond of.
And it disallows the use of Revive items in battle.
Finally, it makes catching a wild Mewtwo more challenging.
As compensation, SET mode gives an additional 1.5x EXP boost in trainer battles.

You can choose RUN while holding SELECT in trainer battles to forfeit the match and black yourself out.

There is a built-in nuzlocke mode that can be toggled from the options menu.

The girl in Oak's lab toggles wild pokemon randomization.
If activated early enough in the game, your starter pokemon choices are randomized as well.

One of the aides in Oak's lab toggles scaling of trainer rosters to your level (evolving them if applicable).

As an alternative to trainer scaling, there is now an obedience level-cap that can be toggled in the options menu.
With the cursor in the BATTLE STYLE section, press A to toggle it on and off.
While active, the current maximum obedience level will display in the options menu.
All pokemon, not just trades, will start to disobey if over the displayed level cap.

The other aide in Oak's lab toggles a pokeball-caught symbol in battle after obtaining the pokedex.
To help with Gen 2 interaction, this also applies a gender symbol to species that can be male or female.

Another aide npc is in the Viridian pokemon center. He will toggle on/off randomization of non-special trainers.

An aide is in the Celadon Diner. He will toggle on/off a catch-up EXP boost function for under-leveled pokemon.

Item, Sleep, and Freeze clauses can each be toggled by the Clause Brothers in Viridian City.
 
The bag now supports an additional item list for an extra 20 slots of space!
Press START on the bag menu to hot-swap the item list that populates the active bag.
The game's systems will generally detect items in the non-active bag space.
Unique systems, such as Pokemon Stadium, will only recognize the active bag's item list.

Each pokemon on your team has a field move slot. 
These slots can temporarily hold a HM move for overworld-use only.
No longer do you have to sacrifice one of your four moves for a HM move.

An experimental New Game+ has been added.
It can be enabled if you have an uncorrupt save file wherein the Elite 4 have been beaten.
Press and hold SELECT while choosing New Game; a jingle confirms activation.

The Cinnabar Lab allows for cloning and genetic modification of pokemon.
It does this by mixing their DVs as of they were akin to genes and alleles.
This replicates the ability to do selective breeding for DVs in a way that's more realistic.

Lots of quick-key features.
- Quick 'Owned' Check - Place the cursor over FIGHT and press Select to play the enemy 'mon cry if it's already owned.
- Softlock Warp - Instantly teleport back to your mom's house if you get stuck.
- Running Shoes - Hold B to double your speed when walking, surfing, and biking. Includes proper animation speed-up!
- Quick HM Use - Press SELECT to use HMs based on proper context.
- Quick Bike/Rod - Press SELECT while holding A to automatically get on/off your bike or use the best rod in your inventory.
- View Stat EXP - Hold SELECT and enter the status screen to print a 'mons stat exp.
- View DVs - Hold START and enter the status screen to print a 'mons DVs.
- View Shiny Palette - When playing in color, hold SELECT when choosing a 'dex entry to load the shiny palette.
  
New NPCs!
- The move relearner and deleter is in Saffron City.
- An NPC in the Celadon Hotel will pay COINS for showing him pokemon as an alternative to slots.
- After the Elite-4, a new vendor opens up in Celadon allowing the purchase of normally unique items.
- After the Elite-4, there is an NPC in the east-west underground path that generates random trainer battles.
- After the Elite-4, the game corner chief will buy pokemon from the player.
- There's a tournament being held in the SS Anne's kitchen after the Elite-4 are beaten. Yes, the ship returns!
- Added some special post-game trainer battles as fun little easter eggs. Can you find and defeat all five?

Changes to fishing!
- All rods have an expanded level range.
- The Old Rod has an expanded 'mon list.
- The Good Rod has an expanded 'mon list.
- The Route 12 Fishing Guru can be visited upon first reaching Lavender Town.
- The locations of the Good and Super Rod have been swapped.

Other minor changes to lessen annoyance.
- Low HP alarm only plays three times then turns itself off.
- TMs and HMs now have their attacks (albeit abbreviated) appended to the item names.
- All TMs can be repurchased as they are strategically scattered across all the Kanto pokemarts.
- The safari zone mechanics run off level instead of speed and safari balls have a boosted catch rate.
- Slot machines are a little more lucky, so now you can actually win big.
- CUT is not needed to get to Lt. Surge and Erika (a blocking event replaces the Vermilion shrub).
- Yellow version learnsets have been integrated and stone evolutions gain back some level-up moves.
- Hitting with a trapping move reduces its user's speed by 25% until recalculated via some other effect.
- Trapping moves play a 'poof' animation on the move's final turn in order to inform the player.
- A recalibrated daycare gives experience points scaled to your gym progress.
- The daycare lets you select moves to forget (if any) upon retreiving your pokemon.
- Retrieving a daycare pokemon that could have evolved via level will trigger evolution and learn any missed-out moves.

Cheats and Secrets!
- A pokemon with Pay Day in your top slot will tip you off to a lucky slot machine and when it's in a special payout mode.
- New item, M.GENE, re-randomizes a pkmn's DVs to values of 9,8,8,8 or more.
- Defeat all five post-game special trainers to reactivate the legendary pokemon.
- To more easily find shiny pokemon, put a level-100 Chansey at the top of your roster. Use a repel if you wish!
- New Super Boss: Do you dare to activate Missingno at the Cinnabar shore? Only if you got your 'dex diploma.
- New Super Boss: Missingno not hard enough for you? Try activating it again at the infamous Seafoam shore!
- Winning the SS Anne's tournament with a pikachu in your party makes that pikachu eligible for the SURF HM.

  - Stat changes from burn and paralyze are applied when the ai sends out a pkmn with those conditions
  - AI routine #2 (prioritize buffing or use a status move) now activates on the 1st turn after sendout instead of the 2nd

- Move fixes
  - Transform-related fixes:
      - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves)

  - the fly/dig invulnerability bit is cleared when a pkmn hurts itself from confusion or is fully paralyzed
  - psywave damage is always min 1 be it an opponent or yourself (prevents desync)
  - Fixed Psywave underflow/overflow with levels of 0, 1, and above 170

    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - Haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck (also fixes the sleep-trap glitch)

     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage move fixes (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc):
    - can no longer critically hit
    - obey type immunities
	- ignore effectiveness text & sfx
	- use 2 bytes for damage instead of 1
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss
  - The effects of Leech Seed and Toxic no longer stack
  - Trapping effects only clear the hyperbeam recharge bit on a hit, preventing its automatic use on a miss
  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Hyper beam must recharge if it knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered
  - To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)
  - Non-link enemy mons now have PP, so always run checks for 0 PP during the disable effect
  - Fixed an issue with Disable's counter on slower 'mons

  
- Graphical Fixes
  - Gym leader names have been restored on the trainer card
    - These were removed during localization as a simple and expedient solution
    - So this is more of a correction to the localization than a strict graphical error
  - Restored intro "Presents" for all builds as localizers did not need to do this for Nintendo of America

- Adjustments to moves  
  - Stat-down moves no longer have a 25% miss chance in AI matches
  - Moves that hit multiple times in a turn now calculate damage and critical hits for each individual attack
  - Trapping moves nerfed big time to prevent the new AI from cheesing them:
    - Switching out of a trapping move ends it immediately and wastes its user's turn (prevents PP underflow glitch too)
	- Each time a trapping move is used and hits, user's speed reduced 25% until recalculated through other mechanics
    - A 'poof' animation plays to signal the last turn of the trapping move
  - Ghost moves (i.e. just Lick) do 2x against psychic as was always intended
  - Pay Day upped to 5x multiplier of later generations
  - Changes to Bide
    - damage accumulation is done after taking a damaging hit instead of during turn execution (less room for glitches)
	- side effect: bide is buffed because multi-hit moves now add damage to bide for each of the 2 to 5 hits
	- changed to Typeless to play nicer with AI routine 3 (it ignores the type chart regardless)
  - Rest's sleep condition increased to 3 turns since attacking on wakeup is now allowed.
  - Acid armor's animation changed so that does not make its user disappear
  - Metronome now classified as a Typeless special damage move to play better with the AI

	- As a tradeoff, attack boosts from rage are kept when it ends
  - Minor code correction to Twineedle to prevent future errors, but this has no effect on gameplay

- Adjustment to stat mods, conditions, and items
  - Sleep does not prevent choosing a move
  - Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
    - The sleep counter's minimum value is increased by +1 to maintain accuracy of sleep moves
  - Badge stat-ups are now only applied in wild pokemon battles to give parity to enemy trainers (only in "SET" style)
  - The effect of X-Accuracy is no longer applied to one-hit K.O. moves (it originally made them auto-hit)
  - Using X-Accuracy with a OHKO move now allows it to hit faster opponents
  - The limiter on vitamins is raised to a max of 62720 stat exp after the elite 4 have been beaten
  - Pkmn added to the player's party (either as a gift or in-game trade) have at the least DVs of 9,8,8,8
  - Upped the power of safari balls
  - Escaping in the safari zone is now based on level instead of speed
  - In "SET" style, X-stat items have double the effect
  
- Trainer ai routine #1 (recognition of stats, hp, and conditions) has been modified
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is heavily discouraged against non-sleeping opponents
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is slightly encouraged against a sleeping opponent
  - using a zero-power confusion effect move is heavily discouraged against confused opponents
  - moves that would miss against an active substitute are heavily discouraged
  - stat buff/debuffs are heavily discouraged if it would have no effect due to hitting the buff/debuff stage limit
  - heavily discourage double-using lightscreen, reflect, mist, substitute, focus energy, and leech seed
  - leech seed won't be used against grass pkmn
  - do not use moves that would be blocked by an active mist effect
  - rules for using healing moves:
    - heavily discourage healing if at max hp
	- slightly encourage healing if below 1/3 hp
	- slightly discourage healing if above 1/2 hp
  - heavily discourage using Counter against a non-applicable move
  - heavily discourage roar, teleport, & whirlwind
  - heavily discourage disable against a pkmn already disabled
  - Substitute discouraged if less that 1/4 hp remains
  - Will discourage using Haze if unstatus'd or has net-neutral or better stat mods
  - Discourages explosion moves in proportion to HP remaining
  - Will heavily discourage boosting defense against special, OHKO, or static-damaging attacks
  - AI layer changes that affect most 0-power moves (with only a few exceptions like heal effects)
    - now has a hard stop on using 0-power moves on consecutive turns with a few effect exceptions
	- heavily discourages 0-power moves if below 1/3 hp
  - Discourage exploding effects if faster than a player in fly/dig state
  - Randomly discourage usage of 2-turn moves when confused/paralyzed
  - 50% chance that the AI is blind to a player switching or using an item
  - Discourage using fly/dig if faster than the player who is also picking fly/dig

- Trainer ai routine #3 (choosing effective moves) has been modified
  - It now heavily discourages moves that would have no effect due to type immunity
  - OHKO moves are heavily discouraged if the ai pkmn is slower than the player pkmn (they would never hit)
  - Static damage moves are randomly preferenced 25% of the time to spice things up
  - Thunder Wave is not used against immune types
  - Poisoning moves discouraged against poison types
  - Added some strategy to handle when the player uses fly/dig
  - Slightly preference regular effectiveness moves if STAB exists (25% chance per move)

- Trainer ai routine #4 is no longer unused. It now does rudimentary trainer switching.
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is below 1/3 HP and player also outspeeds AI
  - chance to switch based on power of incoming supereffective move
  - 12.5% chance to switch if a move is disabled
  - 12.5% chance to switch if afflicted with leech seed
  - 34% chance to switch if afflicted with toxic poison
  - 25% chance to switch if opponent is using a trapping move
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is confused
  - on the lowest stat mod, 12.5% chance to switch per lowered stage
  - There is a chance for the AI to switch a sleeping pokemon based on the sleep counter
    -chance is 0% if counter <= 3
	-chance is 12.5% if counter > 3
  - Additionally, every pokemon in the enemy roster is scored 
    - based on various criteria to determine which mon gets sent out
	- score might dictate that the current mon is the best choice and abort switching
	- an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
	- enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
	- switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
  - AI scoring for switching puts a heavier penalty on potentially switching in a bad type matchup
  - AI scoring imposes a very heavy penalty for potentially switching in pokemon with less than 1/4 HP
  - AI switch scoring now penalizes bad match-ups between player and enemy 'mon types
  
- Trainer ai routine #3 added to the following trainer classes
  - jr trainer M/F, engineer, rocker, juggler, tamer, birdkeeper, black belt, scientist, gentleman
  - bruno, brock, surge, blaine, sabrina, agatha, rival phase 1, chief

  -all rival phases, all gym leaders, elite-4, prof.oak, chief
  
- Trainer stat DVs are now randomly generated to a degree (only in "SET" style)
  - Attack DV is between 9 and 15 and always odd-numbered
  - Defense, special, and speed DVs are between 8 and 15
  - HP DV is a minimum of 8 since attack DV is always odd-numbered
- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so allows for new functionality:
  - Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
  - Trainer pkmn now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level (only in "SET" style)
  - These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Special trainers, e4, and gym leaders are slightly adjusted in their item use
- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn
  - Originally these get reset every time the opponent send out a pkmn (even swithing)
  - Was never really noticed since most trainers never switch nor would have the opportunity
  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch
  
- Adjustments to learnsets and base stats

  - Diglett & Dugtrio can learn cut like in yellow version
  
- Engine changes just for developers
  - The trainer move engine has been backported from Yellow version; trainer movesets can now be fully customized
  - Improved exp calculation for developers who want a level cap between 101 and 255
    - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
	- Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
	- The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
	- For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
  - Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings
  - Adjusted daycare to allow exp values over $500000
  - Allow up to 8 digits when displaying experience on the status screen

    - If the save byte does not match, the player is automatically warped back to Pallet Town
    - Helps prevent crashes and glitches when updating an older save file
    - You will be given the choice to warp to Pallet Town if the rom hack version does not match
  - The function that shows the dex entry for starter pokemon is now more robust
    - It now works for any pokemon (like if the starters are changed or randomized)
	- It keeps a backup of the pokedex-owned flags instead of erasing them
	- Removed the unused Ivysaur flag
  - Increased the maximum game clock to 32767 hours

- Changes to fishing
  - All rods have an expanded level range
  - Old rod can fish up two kinds of pokemon (depending on the current map constant value)
    - Magikarp or Goldeen
	- Magikarp or Poliwag 
  - Good rod can fish up three or four kinds of pokemon (depending on the current map constant value)

	- Goldeen, Shellder, Horsea, Tentacool
  - The Route 12 Fishing Guru is now visitable upon first reaching Lavender Town
  - Swapped location of Good and Super Rod

- Changes to the daycare
  - The daycare lets you select moves to forget (if any) upon retreiving your pokemon
  - Retrieving a daycare pokemon that could have evolved via level will trigger evolution and learn any missed-out moves
  - The daycare will support two evolutions back-to-back
  - The daycare experience gain has been recalibrated
    - It no longer gives 1 exp per step
    - Instead, it falsifies the act of farming wild encounters against a pokemon with a base exp value of 56
    - The falsified encounter starts at level 5, and it increases 5 more levels per badge obtained
    - With 8 badges, using the daycare is essentially a faster way of farming level 45 basic pokemon
    - The downside of not gaining statEXP in the daycare still remains as a tradeoff
  - Added a PC to the daycare
  - Daycare allows HM moves on entered pokemon

- A regular New Game will default the battle style to SET

- Blaine has a touched-up battle sprite so he doesn't look like an alien
  - Snagged this off reddit, but original artist unknown (let me know if this is yours)
- The elite 4 now use the gym battle music rather than the standard trainer music
- The juggler rosters, especially in fuchsia gym, have been slightly altered for flavor
- Just for fun, the last juggler in the fuchsia gym is replaced with a cameo of Janine
  - Though at this point she's still just a cooltrainer and doesn't have a unique battle sprite
- The L: block doesn't disappear when level hits three digits
- Greatly increased the speed and performance of spin tiles  
- Amber and fossils are now non-key items

  - Will replace their roster 'mons with random non-evolved 'mons (legendaries are excluded)
  - The new mons will be swapped with their evolved forms if at a high enough level
  - This feature was added with the intent of spicing-up subsequent Gen-1 playthroughs
- New NPC in celadon hotel will reward coins for showing him requested pkmn
- Move deleter/relearner added to the saffron house below COPYCAT's house
  - Code comes from Mateo's Red++ hack. It's simply the best gen-1 implementation and I cannot come up with something better.
  - Talk to the little girl to delete moves.
  - Talk to her tutor to relearn moves.
  - I have expanded Mateo's code so that it also detects default level-0 moves from the baseStats header files.
- Catch-Up EXP Booster
  - Talk to the aide in the Celadon Diner to toggle this feature.  
  - While active, EXP gained is boosted if the active pokemon's level is lower than that of the fainted enemy.  
  - The boost is 1.5x multiplied by an additional 1.5x for every 3 levels of difference.  
  - For example, a level gap of 12 results in an EXP multiplier of (1.5)^4 = 5.0625.  
  - Use this feature to help you train-up new team members in the mid-to-late game.  
- Can rematch gym leaders and most non gym-leader trainers just by talking to them one or two times
  - Giovanni respawns after leaving the gym so you can rematch him
- Paras is gifted in the Route 2 house in case the player has no pokemon that can learn Cut
- Added a scientist and books to the Cinnabar Lab fossil room for cloning and gene splicing
  - This process clones your 1st spot pokemon and modifies it with DNA from your 2nd spot pokemon.  
  - It does this by treating a pokemon's two bytes of DV values as if they were two genes with two alleles each.  
    - Gene-A has the Attack DV as its hi-side allele and the Defense DV as its lo-side allele.  
	- Gene-B has the Speed DV as its hi-side allele and the Special DV as its lo-side allele.  
	- The A-genes from the two donor pokemon will be mixed to make the clone's A-gene.  
	- The B-genes from the two donor pokemon will be mixed to make the clone's B-gene.  
  - Mixing two genes is done via Punnett Squares, and a random result is chosen based on its ratios.  
  - Within a Punnett quadrant, a hi allele makes the upper digits and a lo allele makes the lower digits.  
  - If two hi allels or two lo alleles fall within a Punnet quadrant, their order is randomly selected.

  - Repel effects will not block shiny encounters
- Shiny Mercy 
  - When a player encounters an AI trainer shiny pokemon, the next wild encounter will be shiny
  - AI trainers can't have shinies in SHIFT mode, so SET mode affords more chances to find wild shinies
- You can now battle missingno on the infamous cinnabar shoreline
  - You must have gotten the pokedex diploma first
  - Activated the traditional way via the "old man in viridian" method
  - The battle will trigger randomly while surfing on the shore even if you are not moving
  - Uses trainer battle routines (different music, uses AI, and uncatchable)
  - Uses its L-block appearance remade as a proper image and has its own defined base stats data
  - If defeated, it will set a non-key item in the sixth bag slot to a quantity of 99
  - Win or lose, you must do the "Old Man" process again to reactivate the encounter
  - For an even harder battle, try using the eastern shore of the seafoam islands
- New Game Plus has been added (still experimental)
  - Activated under these conditions:
    - Must have an existing non-corrupt game save on-file
	- Must have beaten the elite 4 in the on-file save

    - Boxed pokemon
	- Play clock
	- Pokedex seen/owned registry
	- Hall of Fame (experimental)
	- Option screen selections
  - A new trainer ID and hash is generated, so boxed pokemon are permanently treated as traded pokemon
- Winning the SS Anne tournament with a pikachu in the party will set its catch rate to 168
  - In this rom hack, a pikachu with this catch rate can be taught Surf via HM
  - This catch rate makes it hold a gorgeous box if transferred to Gen 2

  - Likewise, a pikachu holding a gorgeous box can learn surf if transferred into this rom hack
- Show Mewtwo to Mr. Fuji after beating the Elite 4 for a M.GENE

#Built-In Nuzlocke Mode
------------------------
- Activation/Deactivation
  - Go to the OPTIONS screen.
  - Place the cursor in the BATTLE ANIMATION section.
  - Press A to toggle nuzlocke mode on or off.
  - The "NUZ!" symbol will appear if nuzlocke mode is on.
  
- Default Options
  - Some options are automatically changed when nuzlocke mode is turned on.
  - The Obedience Level Cap will be activated if the Scale Enemy Trainer Levels feature is inactive.
  - Also, the battle style will change to SET.
  - These are not mandatory changes, and you may reconfigure your options as you wish.
  
- Rule 1: A pokemon that faints is considered dead and can no longer be used.
  - Revival items cannot be used in battle.
  - If a battle ends with no forfeiture, all pokemon with 0 HP are marked dead.
  - If a battle ends in a forfeit, all pokemon with 0 HP before the forfeit are marked dead.
  - Pokemon marked as dead have $05 written to their catch rate to permanently mark them.
  - Even if they are traded back and forth, dead pokemon remain marked as dead while in nuzlocke mode.
  - Medicinal items will not work on pokemon marked as dead, nor will Soft-boiled.
  - Party healing (Mom, Pokemon Center, blacking out, etc) makes a dead pokemon effectively useless.
  - To clarify, it gives a dead pokemon 1 HP, the FRZ status, and 0 PP for all moves.
  - This allows a player to continue the game with boxed pokemon in case of a total party loss.
  - Dead pokemon transferred to Gen-2 games will be holding a pokeball.

- Rule 2: You can only catch the 1st wild pokemon that you encounter in an area.
  - An "area" is defined by the name displayed on the town map.
  - You will be unable to throw balls in subsequent wild battles in that area.
  - Static wild battles count for this as well.
  - Wild battles before you can get pokeballs also count.
  - In light of this, you may want to delay activating nuzlocke mode until pokeballs are available.
  - Story wild battles (Old Man tutorial, Ghost Marowak, and Tower Ghosts) do not apply.
  
- Rule 3 (Optional): Nickname every pokemon you obtain.
  - You will always go straight to the nickname screen without a Yes/No prompt.
  - You can still opt out of a nickname by leaving the entry field blank.
  
- Built-in exceptions:
  - Shiny Clause: Nothing prevents you from throwing balls to catch a wild shiny pokemon.
  - Duplication Clause: Encountering a wild "owned" pokemon will not activate Rule 2.
  - Rule 2 resets for the Safari Zone area upon paying the entrance fee.
  - Catching a pokemon, even if owned, always activates Rule 2. Important for the Safari Zone and New Game+.
  - Dead pokemon can still use overworld moves (HM moves, Teleport, etc).

- Visuale Aides:
  - An Up-Down-Arrow symbol will display on the HUD of a wild pokemon if a ball is allowed to be tossed.
  - This symbol follows Rule 2 and any built-in exceptions previously destribed.

- Nuzlocke and the Safari Zone:
  - The Safari Zone is not inherently limited to a single entry in nuzlocke mode.
  - Entering the Safari Zone gives the player an opportunity to catch 1 pokemon.
  - And this opportunity presents itself each time the player pays the entry fee.

- Nuzlocke and New Game+:
  - New Game+ preserves the pokedex.
  - This means the Duplication Clause will prevent Rule 2 from activating.
  - In light of this, Rule 2 will always activate on an area upon the first catch made there.
  
- Dead pokemon and toggling Nuzlocke mode:
  - It is possible to cheat by turning off nuzlocke mode, healing a dead pokemon, then turning it back on.
  - If this is done, the healed pokemon is still considered dead.
  - This means that party-wide healing will make it useless and medicine still has no effect.
  - This has the potential for a kind of "undead run" rule variant.
 
- Removing the death marker:
  - The only way to undo this is by modifying the dead pokemon's catch rate.
  - This is usually done via the Gen-2 time capsule and trading it back without a hold item or a different hold item.
