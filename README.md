# Shin Pok√©mon Red and Blue

Version 1.12

Download the IPS patch file of the version you want and apply it to its respective USA rom.  

Always apply patches to a fresh USA ROM or else strange glitches will occur.  

Important Note: If you are using a save file from a previous version, you might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Palette Town.

The master github branch will now be used for subsequent beta builds.
Please refer to the backup branches for the last stable version.

This is a rom hack of pokemon red & blue based on the Pret team's disassembly.  
It's a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing game engine bugs and oversights from the original game.  
Additionally, trainer AI routines are improved and multiple quality-of-life improvements have been added.  
Think of it as what the Nintendo Virtual Console re-release of red & blue might have been (plus a few extra goodies).  

Don't like the non-vanilla changes? Prefer only the bugfixes and AI improvements? Want a codebase from which to launch your own rom hack?
Then the [Lite branch](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/tree/lite) is what you want. Head on over and start compiling.

#Summary
-----------

- Tons of bugs, glitches, and oversights fixed
- Trainers are made more difficult not by increasing their team levels, but by doing the following:
  - Vastly improving the default ai routines
  - Giving them access to stat experience (only in "Set" style)
  - Giving them above-average random DVs
  - Trainers of a smart-enough trainer class will make use of basic pkmn switching
  - Badge boosts are not applied in trainer battles (only in "Set" style)
- One of OAK's aides will toggle on/off scaling of trainer rosters to your level (evolving them if applicable)
- All 151 pkmn are available in one version
  - Though difficult for a select few, each pkmn can be obtained multiple times
  - The uniqueness between red & blue is still preserved in encounter rarity
- You can play as a boy or a girl
- You can hunt for shiny pokemon
  - DVs are checked to see if a pokemon would be shiny in the gen 2 games
  - If a pokemon has shiny DVs, then it will play the Reflect animation when entering battle
  - If playing on a super gameboy, shiny pkmn will have a palette swap on the status screen and also change color in battle
- Minor quality-of-life improvements during battle
  - When a when a box is filled (either via catching or depositing a pokemon), notification text is displayed
  - Exp bar in battle
  - A pkmn plays its cry to signal the last turn of using a trapping move like wrap/clamp/etc
  - The safari zone mechanics run off level instead of speed and safari balls have a boosted catch rate
  - Press Select to play a mon's cry if it's already listed as owned in the pokedex
- Minor quality-of-life improvements outside of battle
  - Softlock Warp: instantly teleport back to your mom's house if you get stuck (see instructions in detailed changes below)
  - Running Shoes: Hold B to double your speed when walking, surfing, and biking
  - Press SELECT to use HMs based on proper context (must have the right badge and the move on one of your pkmn)
  - Press Select while holding A to automatically get on/off your bike or use the best rod in your inventory 
  - Move relearner and deleter
  - Nearly all trainers can be rematched just by talking to them a 2nd time after their most recent defeat
  - Due to on-demand rematches, you could do a pseudo-"new game+" by boxing your pkmn and rematching everyone in order
  - All TMs can be repurchased as they are strategically scattered across all the Kanto pokemarts
  - Hold select and enter the status screen to print a 'mons stat exp
  - Hold start and enter the status screen to print a 'mons DVs
  - Slot machine bugs and oversights fixed so now you can actually win big
  - A pokemon having Pay Day will tip you off to the lucky slot machine and when it's in a special payout mode
  - An NPC will pay COINS for showing him pokemon as an alternative to slots
  - After the elite-4, a new vendor opens up in celadon allowing the purchase of normally unique items
  - After the elite-4, there is an NPC that generates a trainer battle with a randomized 6-pkmn roster
  - There's a tournament being held in the SS Anne's kitchen after the elite 4 are beaten
  - CUT not needed to get to Lt. Surge and Erika (a blocking event replaces the Vermilion shrub)
  - Added some special trainer battles as fun little easter eggs
- Minor learnset changes that make things more convenient while still staying gen-1 legal
  - Stone evolutions regain some level-up moves
  - Yellow-version move lists have been integrated
- Minimal changes to battle mechanics necessitated by AI improvements
  - Trapping move mechanics nerfed to prevent PP underflow glitch as well as stopping merciless, unwinnable abuse by AI trainers
	- They now end, ending the turn with no further attack, if the target switches pkmn
	- Upon hitting, user's speed reduced 25% until recalculated through other mechanics
	- The user's Cry is played on the final turn of a trapping move to signal its end
  - Adjustment to the sleep condition
    - Sleep does not prevent choosing a move
	- Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
- Compatible with original Gameboy hardware (DMG, Super, Pocket, Color, Advance, SP)
- Potentially compatible with Pokemon Stadium 1 & 2
- Might be possible to use a save from vanilla USA red/blue with this rom hack (save in RED's house before transferring over)

-----------
- The surfboard now works with smart hm use. It just has to be in your bag

  - Moves no longer have a default 1/256 chance to miss
  - Fixed freeze that occurs in defense stat scaling (def < 4 glitch)
  - Enemy ai ignores type effectiveness for moves that have zero power
     - prevents things like spamming agility against poison pkmn
  - Enemy ai ignores super-effectiveness for moves that do static amounts of damage
  - Fixed skipping move-learn on level-up glitch. 
     - when gaining multiple levels at a time, each in-between level is incrementally checked for moves learned
     - this prevents a pkmn from skipping learnable moves if gaining multiple levels in battle
	 - also does this when evolving via level-up for the new evolution's movelist
  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore
  - The function that applies badge stat-ups now selectively boosts the correct stat when called during a stat-up/down effect
  - If player is frozen, the hyperbeam recharge bit is now cleared
     - now matches how enemy mon's recharge bit is cleared upon being frozen
     - this prevents getting stuck in a loop unable to do anything on your turn
  - Blaine will not use a healing item at full HP
  - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves).
  - The BIRD type has been reinstated and renamed to TYPELESS. It acts as a universally neutral type (particularly for Struggle)
  - AI trainers have priority on switching or using an item
  - AI type effectiveness function now takes type 1 and 2 into account together 
	 - Before AI would only look at the type it encountered first in a list search
     - AI will now treat a move as neutral if type 1 makes it supereffective but type 2 makes it not effective
  - Stat changes from burn and paralyze are applied when the ai sends out a pkmn with those conditions
  - AI routine #2 (prioritize buffing or use a status move) now activates on the 1st turn after sendout instead of the 2nd
  - New custom function for undoing the stat changes of burn and paralysis
    - undoing paralysis is accurate to within 0 to -3 points
    - undoing burn is accurate to within 0 to -1 point
  
- Move fixes
  - dire hit/focus energy now quadruples crit rate instead of quarters
  - sleep now normal-chance hits a pkmn recharging from hyperbeam, but has no effect if it's already status-effected
  - the fly/dig invulnerability bit is cleared when a pkmn hurts itself from confusion or is fully paralyzed
  - psywave damage is always min 1 be it an opponent or yourself (prevents desync)
  - Substitute fixes
    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - Haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck
     - Fixed by allowing sleeping/frozen pkmn to use a move after haze restores them
     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage moves (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc) can no longer critically hit
  - fixed-damage moves now obey type immunities
  - Transform will no longer copy the opponent's Transform move. It's swapped-out for Struggle
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss
  - The effects of Leech Seed and Toxic no longer stack
  - Trapping effects only clear the hyperbeam recharge bit on a hit, preventing its automatic use on a miss
  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Hyper beam must recharge if it knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered

    - A pkmn plays its cry to signal the last turn of the trapping move
  - Ghost moves (i.e. just Lick) do 2x against psychic as was always intended
  - Pay Day upped to 8x multiplier instead of 2x
    - It's 5x in later generations, but amulet coin doesn't exist in gen 1. 8x is a compromise.
