- Copy over the move_relearner.asm that's in the text folder

- Copy over the move_relearner.asm that's in the scripts folder
- Copy over the move_deleter.asm that's in the scripts folder

The master and lite branches have undergone an organizational change so that the move relearn/delete nps can be added via tags in the makefile.

Open the makefile in a text editor like notepad++ and scroll down to the assembler tags.
You can tell you're in the right place because the lines start with "rgbasm -D".

You'll notice that each rom has a list of assembler tags assigned. Usually _RED or _BLUE and some others.
You can add the _MOVENPCS tag to compile the rom with code that allows for this option.

EXAMPLE: Say you wanted to compile red version with this feature.
You would modify the tags for red version from this

	%_red.o: dep = $(shell tools/scan_includes $(@D)/$*.asm)
	$(pokered_obj): %_red.o: %.asm $$(dep)
		rgbasm -D _RED -h -o $@ $*.asm

To this

	%_red.o: dep = $(shell tools/scan_includes $(@D)/$*.asm)
	$(pokered_obj): %_red.o: %.asm $$(dep)
		rgbasm -D _RED -D _MOVENPCS -h -o $@ $*.asm


All code involving this feature is searchable via the _MOVENPCS tag.
This allows it to be easily differentiated from the code around it.
Utilize this if you wish to add the feature code to your own project.
