Bit 0 of wram location $D721 (called wUnusedD721) determines the sex of the player. 
A 0 makes for a boy and 1 makes for a girl.
Normally this wram location goes unused. Make a note in wram.asm for your reference.

The master and lite branches have undergone an organizational change so that the female trainer can be added via tags in the makefile.

Open the makefile in a text editor like notepad++ and scroll down to the assembler tags.
You can tell you're in the right place because the lines start with "rgbasm -D".

You'll notice that each rom has a list of assembler tags assigned. Usually _RED or _BLUE and some others.
You can add the _FPLAYER tag to compile the rom with code that allows for a female trainer option.

EXAMPLE: Say you wanted to compile red version with a female trainer selectable.
You would modify the tags for red version from this

	%_red.o: dep = $(shell tools/scan_includes $(@D)/$*.asm)
	$(pokered_obj): %_red.o: %.asm $$(dep)
		rgbasm -D _RED -h -o $@ $*.asm

To this

	%_red.o: dep = $(shell tools/scan_includes $(@D)/$*.asm)
	$(pokered_obj): %_red.o: %.asm $$(dep)
		rgbasm -D _RED -D _FPLAYER -h -o $@ $*.asm


All code involving the female trainer is searchable via the _FPLAYER tag.
This allows it to be easily diferentiated from the code around it.
Utilize this if you wish to add the female trainer code to your own project.
