The master and lite branches have undergone an organizational change so that sprite sets can be controlled via tags in the makefile.

Open the makefile in a text editor like notepad++ and scroll down to the assembler tags.
You can tell you're in the right place because the lines start with "rgbasm -D".

You'll notice that each rom has a list of assembler tags assigned. Usually _RED or _BLUE and some others.
The comments above describe each of the available tags. 

These are the tags you can add in order to modify the battle sprites:
_SWSPRITES modifies any base rom but cannot be used with other _*SPRITES tags. It uses spaceworld front 'mon sprites (pic/swmon folder).
_YSPRITES modifies any base rom but cannot be used with other _*SPRITES tags. It uses yellow front 'mon sprites (pic/ymon folder).
_RGSPRITES modifies any base rom but cannot be used with other _*SPRITES tags. It uses redjp/green front 'mon sprites (pic/rgmon folder).
_SWBACKS modifies any base rom. It uses spaceworld 48x48 back sprites for 'mons & trainers (pic/swmonback folder and pic/swtrainerback folder). 

EXAMPLE: Say you wanted to compile red version with spaceworld back sprites and yellow front sprites.
You would modify the tags for red version from this

	%_red.o: dep = $(shell tools/scan_includes $(@D)/$*.asm)
	$(pokered_obj): %_red.o: %.asm $$(dep)
		rgbasm -D _RED -h -o $@ $*.asm

To this

	%_red.o: dep = $(shell tools/scan_includes $(@D)/$*.asm)
	$(pokered_obj): %_red.o: %.asm $$(dep)
		rgbasm -D _RED -D _SWBACKS -D _YSPRITES -h -o $@ $*.asm
